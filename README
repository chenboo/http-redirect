http-redirect -- A minimalist HTTP server redirecting to another address

  This program is designed to use as little memory as possible. Each time it
receives an HTTP request, it will send back a 301 redirect to the specified
address.

  It is intended to be run on machines that are not supposed to act as HTTP
servers (for instance, if example.com is not the same machine as
www.example.com and example.com doesn't run an HTTP server, you might want to
setup http-redirect on it).

  Example usage:
    http-redirect -p 80 http://www.google.com/
